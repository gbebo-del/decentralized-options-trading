# Decentralized Options Trading Protocol

A secure and decentralized options trading protocol implemented in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain, following the SIP-010 token standard.

## Overview

This protocol enables users to create, trade, and exercise options contracts in a trustless manner. It supports both CALL and PUT options with built-in price feeds, collateral management, and automated exercise functionality.

## Features

- **SIP-010 Compatibility**: Full compliance with the SIP-010 fungible token standard
- **Flexible Options**: Support for both CALL and PUT options
- **Collateral Management**: Automated collateral locking and release
- **Price Oracle Integration**: Built-in price feed system for accurate option pricing
- **Position Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of written and held options
- **Protocol Fees**: Configurable fee structure for sustainable protocol operation
- **Access Control**: Robust permission system for administrative functions
- **Token Whitelist**: Approved token system for enhanced security

## Core Functions

### Option Writing

```clarity
(write-option
    (token <sip-010-trait>)
    (collateral-amount uint)
    (strike-price uint)
    (premium uint)
    (expiry uint)
    (option-type (string-ascii 4)))
```

Creates a new option contract with specified parameters:

- `token`: SIP-010 compliant token used for collateral
- `collateral-amount`: Amount of collateral to lock
- `strike-price`: Exercise price of the option
- `premium`: Cost to purchase the option
- `expiry`: Block height at which the option expires
- `option-type`: "CALL" or "PUT"

### Option Purchase

```clarity
(buy-option
    (token <sip-010-trait>)
    (option-id uint))
```

Allows users to purchase an existing option by paying the premium.

### Option Exercise

```clarity
(exercise-option
    (token <sip-010-trait>)
    (option-id uint))
```

Enables option holders to exercise their options before expiration.

## Data Structures

### Option Contract

```clarity
{
    writer: principal,
    holder: (optional principal),
    collateral-amount: uint,
    strike-price: uint,
    premium: uint,
    expiry: uint,
    is-exercised: bool,
    option-type: (string-ascii 4),
    state: (string-ascii 9)
}
```

### User Position

```clarity
{
    written-options: (list 10 uint),
    held-options: (list 10 uint),
    total-collateral-locked: uint
}
```

## Security Features

1. **Collateral Validation**

   - Automatic verification of sufficient collateral
   - Safe collateral locking and release mechanisms

2. **Access Control**

   - Owner-only administrative functions
   - Protected price feed updates
   - Token whitelist management

3. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error codes
   - Robust input validation
   - State consistency checks

## Administrative Functions

### Protocol Management

```clarity
(set-protocol-fee-rate (new-rate uint))
(set-approved-token (token principal) (approved bool))
(set-allowed-symbol (symbol (string-ascii 10)) (allowed bool))
```

### Price Feed Management

```clarity
(update-price-feed
    (symbol (string-ascii 10))
    (price uint)
    (timestamp uint))
```

## Error Codes

| Code | Description             |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| 1000 | Not authorized          |
| 1001 | Insufficient balance    |
| 1002 | Invalid expiry          |
| 1003 | Invalid strike price    |
| 1004 | Option not found        |
| 1005 | Option expired          |
| 1006 | Insufficient collateral |
| 1007 | Already exercised       |
| 1008 | Invalid premium         |
| 1009 | Invalid token           |
| 1010 | Invalid symbol          |
| 1011 | Invalid timestamp       |
| 1012 | Invalid address         |
| 1013 | Zero address            |
| 1014 | Empty symbol            |

## Best Practices for Integration

1. **Collateral Management**

   - Always verify token approval before interaction
   - Maintain sufficient collateral for written options
   - Monitor option expiration dates

2. **Price Feed Usage**

   - Verify price feed freshness
   - Implement price feed redundancy
   - Monitor for significant price deviations

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Validate all inputs before contract interaction
   - Monitor transaction status

## Development and Testing

To interact with the protocol:

1. Deploy the contract to the Stacks blockchain
2. Configure approved tokens and price feeds
3. Set protocol fee rate
4. Begin writing or trading options

## Limitations

- Maximum of 10 written options per user
- Maximum of 10 held options per user
- Price feeds must be maintained by contract owner
- Only approved tokens can be used for collateral

## Security Considerations

1. **Price Feed Manipulation**

   - Price feeds are critical for option exercise
   - Implement oracle security measures
   - Monitor for unusual price movements

2. **Collateral Risk**

   - Maintain adequate collateral
   - Monitor option positions
   - Understand exercise conditions

3. **Smart Contract Risk**
   - Review code before interaction
   - Understand error conditions
   - Monitor contract upgrades
